* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

### Overall Conduct

This section defines how each class member should and should not act while
participating in CMPSC 203 course during Spring 2021 semester. Everyone is
required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight
sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that
members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender identity, as learners. This
is a course in which individuals have different skillsets and different
levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a class member
for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other
people's work is a core part of learning how to develop software effectively, yet when
used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their
permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact
project's success. Therefore, members of this course should also adhere to
Allegheny's honor code for all submitted work.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Show respect for all peers as learners and team members.
    * Allow peers to voice their opinions and questions.
    * Read, understand, and follow all parts of this code of Conduct.
    * Follow the honor code on all submitted work.
    * Learn from the knowledge and opinions of teachers and peers.
    * Respect, listen, and consider all ideas and contributions made by teammates
    * Dress and act appropriately during online or in-person class sessions

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Disrespect peers because of their race or gender.
    * Prevent peers from voicing their opinions and questions.
    * Violate any part of this Code of Conduct.
    * Violate the Allegheny honor code in regards to all submitted work.
    * Act with malicious intent to any student.
    * Be rude to team members when introducting criticism.
    * Threaten any class members for any reason.
    * Prevent peers from participating in group assignments.

#### Attendance

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Make every effort to be present in one capacity or another in every class
    * Communicate with the professor beforehand in the event a class must be missed

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Turn in work past the due date and time given.

#### Communication

This section defines what communication is acceptable and unacceptable. It is vital that team members not only communicate clearly, but communicate using the right platforms and methods, such as GitHub issues tracker or slack. For example, something may be clearly communicated in Slack, but may still receive an 'unacceptable' because Slack was the inappropriate platform to use.

    * Give and accept constructive criticism.
    * Listen to and consider ideas presented by others.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Frequently use inappropriate forums such as text messaging or using Slack instead of GitHub issues tracker.
    * Rarely engage in the discussion.
    * Use communication platforms inappropriately.
    * Attend lab sessions and meetings without appropriate electronic communication devices.

## Team Work

Some of the class activities and lab projects will require team collaboration.
This section of the Code of Conduct will provide guidance on effective and
inclusive team work.

### Participation

Every team member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the projects at hand. This will ensure the flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our project at its root includes participation, candidness and insightful collaboration. Participating in project discussion means engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and truly be all there.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Value and consider everyoneâ€™s opinion.
    * Approach issues and team members with professionalism. (Specifically, using "I" statements.)
    * Demonstrate continuous engagement with tasks.
    * Raise a disagreeing opinion in a respectful manner.
    * Respond to ideas, not the person presenting them.
    * Make an effort to engage with all team members and a wide variety of classmates.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Demonstrate disrespect for team members.
    * Violate the professional boundaries of team members or classmates whether those boundries be *ibnlt* personal, professional, emotional, or ideological.
    * Show poor participation and attitude to their delegated tasks.
    * Showing up extremely late or not showing up for group meeting without prior notice.

### Decisions

The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the
project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows
that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should
reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine
how long a decision will take to implement.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process.
    * Stay flexible and be willing to change if it would be productive.
    * Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members.
    * When a choice is disputed, use Github issue tracker and let team members
      share their opinion.
    * Defer to the Professor or Technical Leaders when unsure about tasks or implementation.
    * Use efficient communication within and outside of teams, where ideas are clearly expressed in the shortest possible timeframe.
    * Communicate with the appropriate team member about any changes that is needed to be done to any project.
    * Stay respectful and open-minded when discussing decisions and ideas.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Let an individual team member or a project manager make all major decisions.
    * Make decisions without finding evidence showing that it would likely be beneficial.
    * Refuse to work on the decided option.
    * Make decisions that would affect another team without first notifying them.
    * Refuse to actively participate in group discussions or breakout rooms.
    * Deploy any kind of decision that is against codes of ethic.
    * Mock a team member's decision.
    * Refuse to do any assigned work in general.
    * Make decisions without consolation of the rest of the group.
    * Go behind the backs of other group members to make decisions.
    * Share constructive criticism of others opinions before making a final decision as a group.

### Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of
the project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was
successful and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also
provide great insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of the project.
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
      while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct.
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced.
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve future projects and assignments.
    * Consider all possible angles and opinions when determining what is good feedback.
    * Thoroughly consider all feedback regardless of how it may initially seem.
    * Respect the results of a postmortem that the group has decided.
    * Receive feedback as a team, to prevent singling out.
    * Listen to everyone's input and consider and respect what they have to say

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism.
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product.
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues while a project or lab has not been completed.
    * Dismiss feedback before considering whether it is good or not.
    * Single out specific team members when discussing the results of a project or a lab.
    * Make fun of or belittle people's inputs/contributions.
    * Be closed minded in regard to correct solutions.

### Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful conversations.
    * If conflicts become severe between class members, they should be brought
      to the attention of the project managers who will work to resolve any issues.
    * Project managers, technical leaders and the course instructor are
      responsible for resolving any issues by proposing solutions to reach a
      compromise between class members involved.
    * Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a conflict.
    * The course instructor has a final say in how severe conflicts should be resolved.
    * Establish a clear line of communication with other members before conflicts are brought to technical leaders or the instructor
    * Maintain a professional working environment between colleagues when collaborating for projects.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the code of conduct.
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project.
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict that has been brought to their attention.
    * Spread the conflict to outside of the group and into the class sessions.
    * Avoid conflicts and allow them to escelate when they could have been easily and quickly resolved.

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed
rules present in the code of conduct. Any action
that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of
previous infractions. Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher
level infraction and thus a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor code
guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all students in Allegheny College and
is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this code of conduct only
includes members of the Software Engineering class for the spring semester of 2021..

*Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*

* Level I: Any violation of a code of conduct rule is by default a Level I infraction. Technical leaders and instructor will be keeping track of infractions.
- Warning to the student not to repeat their behavior
- The offending student must commit to working towards amending the infraction and avoiding future infractions.

* Level II: Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.
- Student must formally apologize to the affected party.
- Student is required to communicate with the professor to discuss continued participation in class.
- Student may receive a reduced or failing grade for the affected project.

* Level III: A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has accumulated five Level I infractions.
- Student is required to communicate weekly with the professor to discuss continued participation in class.
- Depending on the severity of the infraction, student may receive a failing grade for the project and/or class, at the discretion of the professor.

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe, inclusive and collegial environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class.
Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.

Class member(s) may be reduced 10 percent of their final grade due to not following the rules.
